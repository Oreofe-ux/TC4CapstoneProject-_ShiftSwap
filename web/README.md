# Shift Swap

## About
This project includes a mobile app and a website. We would be working as a team using GitHub.
Also this is our main branch

## Folder Structure
- web/ : this folder is for our web dashboard's code
- mobile/ : this is for the mobile app in case we are the ones designing it, if not we'd most likely not be using it 
- assets/ : this should contain the images we'd be using, fonts, colors and other shared files.

## Team Rules
1. Do NOT code on the main branch
2. Everyone contributing must create their own branch
3. Push your own branch to github, not the main one please.
4. Use pull requests, more information on this coming later.

## Example commands for cloning, creating your own branch and pushing it
git clone REPO_link
git checkout -b your-branch-name-eg.loginUI
git add .
git commit -m "what you created in your branch"
git push origin your-branch-name
